## What to Do Next

Once you have your keys, tell me:
- "I have my OpenAI key: sk-..."
- "I have my Anthropic key: sk-ant-..."
- "I have my Google AI key: AIza..."

Or just paste them all at once, and I'll add them to your .env file automatically!

**Quick Tip**: You can get all three keys in about 10 minutes. Start with Anthropic (easiest, free) or Google AI (also free), then do OpenAI (requires payment setup).
